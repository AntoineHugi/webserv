		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome! This site was created to provide a simple, clean space for learning,
			experimenting, and sharing ideas (lol). We believe in keeping things lightweight,
			approachable, and user-friendly — whether you're asking chatgpt to create an html,
			questioning your professional choices, or just procrastinating on your projects.
		</p>

		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>
			Our goal is to pass three (3) evaluations for this project so that we can move on, find a job,
			and finally get paid again. Anything else than that is none of your business, please respect our privacy.
		</p>

		<h2>What We Do</h2>
		<p>
			That is a good question, something we've asked ourselves many times too. So far, no clear answer has
			emerged,
			but well we built this at least. Let's revisit this question at a latter time.
		</p>

		<h2>Get in Touch</h2>
		<p>
			Have ideas, questions, or something you'd like to share?
			We’re not the right people for that. Go to slack maybe, or your local späti.
			Seriously, don't contact us.
		</p>
