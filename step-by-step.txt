Suggestions : 
	- do the parsing and validation in the handle_read section (read everything -> parse header -> validate header -> if needed parse body -> validate body  => all this fills out information needed to process the request)
	- first just read everything into an unparsed header string and header body, then do the parsing & validation
	- some request validation is happening in the processing part, should perhaps be moved into validation
	- handle_disconnection could be renamed to closeConnection, which might be called by handleConnection
	- since clients are only attached to one server/port, should the array of clients sit in server instead of service? would make circular inclusion easier and no need to have a server attribute in client class



Object Strcture proposal : 

Service
	-> Server (rename to port?)
		-> Route
		-> Method (just functions for handling requests)
		-> Client
			-> Request
			-> Response
